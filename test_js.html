        There once was a 
        <span id='nouna'> NOUN </span>
        that decided to 
        <span id='verba'> VERB </span> 
        while a 
        <span id='nounb'> NOUN </span> 
        chose to
        <span id='verbb'> 2ND VERB </span>.
        They were both very 
        <span id='adja'> ADJECTIVE </span> and
        <span id='adjb'>2ND ADJECTIVE</span>. THE END
